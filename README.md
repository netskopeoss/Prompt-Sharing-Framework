# Prompt-Sharing-Framework
Purpose of project :

The purpose of this project is to create a collaborative framework that acts as the central, global standard for sharing high-quality, reusable AI prompts. The ultimate goal is to democratize AI development, empowering users worldwide to build and customize powerful tools, which in turn accelerates innovation and global knowledge sharing.   


Purpose of framework :

The framework's purpose is to provide access to the complete blueprints for effective AI assistants, which includes sharing the prompts, configurations, and source documents used to build them. It is specifically intended to define how prompts are shared, rather than how the prompts themselves are built.


What problem are we trying to solve :

The problem this project is trying to solve is that there is currently no similar standard notation available in the open-source community for sharing these AI prompts and blueprints.


Our Goals For AI Development :

To democratize AI by establishing a trusted, high-quality standard that accelerates innovation and empowers users worldwide to build powerful, custom tools.


For Contributors :

Contributors will gain invaluable experience, learn from their peers, and build a public portfolio of their expertise, which enhances their skills and professional reputation. In return, the project's engagement model is built on active collaboration, and we "absolutely expect and encourage contributions" to co-develop this new standard with the community. We are specifically seeking crucial feedback from contributors to influence the framework’s direction based on their real-world needs. We are also inviting the community to collaborate on the active development, testing, and documentation to build the final, high-quality framework.
